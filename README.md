ARe you ready is an augmented reality simulation Android mobile app that allows us to enjoy AR features with simple mini-games. This project was created with AR Foundation, unity, and pun2 for multiplayer.

This project includes:

1. Multiplayer simulation
Players can join with various players through the lobby room network system, and all game objects are synchronized so that their changes are shown equally to all players at the same time. Each player can change the color of the cube to the color that represents themselves by clicking on the cube, and the player who paints the most cubes in their color within a set time wins. it is a multiplayer AR simulation game.
2. Bowling simulation
Players can play a bowling game with simple physics by placing bowling pins and balls based on the real world using AR features like plane detection and object placement. When the bowling pin is placed, the shape of the bowling pin is determined as a unique object by calculating the playerâ€™s GPS information if the player is at a specific location. For example, if the player is at the coordinates of Starbucks, it is spawned as a mug, and if the player is in the library, it is spawned as a book.
3. AR student ID card
By using image tracking, it recognizes the student I previously stored in this project and displays an AR object around it. AR objects sense and track the movement of the recognized image.
